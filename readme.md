This lab try to understand the databases based on graphs using Grakn

## Introduction

The databases are a necessary and indispensable component in each type of system where the persistence of data is desired, for this component present in an architecture there are different methods, paradigms and models to follow to make the modeling of the structures and data which One of the best known and interesting is the base in graphs. The advantages of using a graph-based database is scalability and flexibility. Unlike the relational and non-relational database, these provide a great contribution as the system grows as it becomes easier to add or remove nodes. In this laboratory, we try to recreate a database based on graphs taking into account the structure of a social network.
